        <p id="con">Trump becoming president doesn't bode well for the future of EV's. When he becomes president, Trump will cut a $7500 tax credit towards EV's that will reduce their sales by so much, the entire car market will be massivly affected. While some in urban areas won't be affected, others who need cheap transportation in rural ares will be left empty-handed. In response to this, some states will reinstate EV tax credit.</p>
