                <h2>Electric Cars</h2>
                <p>
                    Electric cars, also known as EV's (Electric Vehicles), run on electricity from batteries; they produce zero emissions and lower operating costs. They are eco-friendly, with growing affordability and improved range and charging speeds. Their rising popularity is a driving force in the car industry, with manufacturers increasingly investing in EV technology and phasing out traditional combustion engines. However, the EV industry might have a new enemy, as Donald Trump returns to office next January.

                <h2>Trumps' Presidency</h2>
                <p>
                    The next president of the United States, Donald Trump, is a longtime advocate for oil-based fuels and against EV's. According to Invesopedia, Trump has vowed to upend electric cars by cutting a tax credit for $7500 that many EV owners rely on. Although Trump is friends with Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and pioneer of electric cars, many believe that he will still go through with this tax credit cut. In fact, Musk himself has openly supported this cut, believing that his company won't get hurt anywhere near as much as other big EV companies like Ford or GM.
