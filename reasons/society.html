        <h2>Effects on Cities vs. Agrarian Society</h2>
        <p>
            Although a massive price surge in the car industry is detrimental to all parts of society, certain areas are more affected than others. In denser, older urban areas like New York or D.C., this effect is a lot less pronounced, as many people can just walk or take a cab where they need to go. However, newer cities like LA and Miami will be more affected, as they are tens of miles across, and require personal transportation for efficiency. These areas are still very well-off, and can afford this cut/rapid inflation. The most devastation will happen in sparser, rural areas, where people are generally worse off, and cars are needed for transportation. Coincidentally, these rural areas tend to vote red, and so their vote in this election is in some ways hurthing them. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel as this credit-cut is at a federal level.
