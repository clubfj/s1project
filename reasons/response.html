        <h2>States' Response</h2>
        <p>
            If this $7500 credit is no longer available at the federal level, some states have vowed to reinstate EV credit at the state level. For example, California govenor Gavin Newson has declared that he will try to reinstate a project called the "Clean Vehicle Rebate Program". This program funded 600,000 EV's and saved 456 million gallons of fuel. This program also offered rebates up to $2500 on electric car. This isn't anywhere near the $7500 that Trump is on course to get rid of, but it will still help California's car industry to stay strong. Other states that offer similar programs but to a lesser extent include: Maryland, Delaware, Colorado, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Hampshire.
