        <h2>What happens if this credit cut goes through?</h2>
        <p>
            If Trump succedes in his goal of creating a tax cut, EV prices are expected to surge 27%. The New York Times recently did study for $4900 EV tax credit cut in germany, showing that price increased 25% over ten months. If something similar were to happen in the US, the drop in sales would lead to 315,000 less EV's being produced every year. As EV's are the fastest growing part of the car industry, this rapid inflation in price would not only affect EV's, but also the entire rest of the car industry. This will have a profound effect on society, as it will make transportation a lot more expensive.
